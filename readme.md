#Grafici

Grafici is a dead-simple JavaScript-based SVG graph generator for simple charting purposes. Provide Grafici with a table of numerical data and it will generate a simple SVG graph and insert it into the DOM. 

It is designed to be as lightweight as possible, with no dependencies. See the example for usage details.
